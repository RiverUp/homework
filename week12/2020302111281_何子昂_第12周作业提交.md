BGP routers use the AS-PATH attribute to detect and prevent looping advertisements; specifically, if a router sees that its own AS is contained in the path list, it will reject the advertisement.

C gives its route to D only on the east coast via its east coast peering point.

Since Z wants to transmit the traffic from Y, Z will send a routing broadcast to Y. Thus, when Y has a datagram sending to an IP address which is reachable through Z, Y will have the option of sending that datagram through Z. However, if Z forwards routes to Y, Y can re-log those routes to X. Therefore, in this case, Z cannot block the transmission from X to Z.

Typically, the time when the network management is the most essential is also the when the congestion is the most severe. The datagram is inevitably losing. So if we run the SNMP on the TCP, the effiecncy can be very low.
